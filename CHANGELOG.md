# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Breaking**: log through `log/slog`. `Logger`, `WithLogger` and the `utp` package's
  `WithLogger` option now take a `*slog.Logger` instead of an `anacrolix/log.Logger`. The
  package-level `Logger` in both implementations starts out nil, which means a Socket created
  without `WithLogger` logs to `slog.Default()` as it stands when the Socket is created. Records
  carry attributes rather than formatted values, and go out at a level that suits them: read
  errors at warn, giving up on a socket at error, and everything else at debug. The categories
  `Socket.SetLogging` turns on are logged at debug, with a `category` attribute, and keep their
  libutp-shaped message text so the two implementations' logs can still be read side by side.
  `purego` now imports nothing outside the standard library
- Add `purego`, a pure Go implementation of µTP ported from the vendored libutp sources. It needs
  no cgo and no C++ compiler, and offers the same API shape as the wrapper: `Socket` implements
  `net.Listener` and `net.PacketConn`, and its connections implement `net.Conn`. The state
  machine, LEDBAT congestion control, selective acknowledgements and fast resend, retransmission
  timers and MTU search follow libutp closely, including its constants
- Add `utp`, one interface over both implementations, selected at build time. `utp.Default` is
  libutp; the `purego` build tag or `CGO_ENABLED=0` makes it `utp.Purego` and leaves the C++
  sources uncompiled. `utp.Socket` and `utp.Implementation` are both interfaces, so code can be handed
  either implementation as a value: `utp.Purego` is always available, `utp.Libutp` wherever libutp
  is compiled. An `Implementation` makes a `Socket` over a `net.PacketConn`, and `utp.Listen`
  opens a port for one. `utp.NewSocket` and `utp.NewSocketFromPacketConn` use `utp.Default` and
  match the signatures of the constructors of those names in both underlying packages. The shared
  tunables are `WithLogger`, `WithBufferSizes`, `WithTargetDelay` and `Socket.SetLogging`
- Add `interop`, which tests the two implementations against each other on the wire: transfers in
  both directions, bidirectional transfers, ping-pong, and transfers over a link that drops,
  delays and duplicates packets. Every case runs over each ordered pair of implementations, so
  each is also tested against itself, with libutp against libutp as the control. `purego` also
  passes `nettest.TestConn`
- CI: add a `purego` job covering the build tag and the cgo-off build, mirrored by
  `just test-purego` and `just test-nocgo`

## v1.5.1 — 2026-08-17

- Clamp the peer-supplied uTP delay sample before it reaches the average-delay
  accumulator. A crafted `reply_micro` exactly half the 32-bit space from the
  baseline previously produced a sample of `-2^31` (or `+2^31-1` on the other
  branch) that tripped the `current_delay_sum` assertion and aborted the whole
  process. Reported against Erigon (erigontech/security#78); the same
  arithmetic is present in upstream bittorrent/libutp.
- Repair the MTU floor/ceiling range instead of asserting on it. A dropped MTU
  probe in steady state, or an interface/ICMP-reported MTU below the search
  floor, could leave `mtu_floor > mtu_ceiling` and abort on
  `assert(mtu_floor <= mtu_ceiling)` (bittorrent/libutp #105, #130). Both fixes
  mirror the corresponding handling in libtorrent's uTP implementation.
- Add a `justfile` mirroring the CI jobs, so `just test`, `just bench` and `just asan` run
  locally exactly what CI runs
- CI: drive the test, benchmark and asan jobs through the justfile
- asan: leak checks are now clean on macOS too. Tests under the `lsan` build tag also build with
  `netgo` to skip the C resolver, and `lsan_suppressions.txt` suppresses the remaining
  libdispatch/XPC allocations that macOS never frees. Both are inert on Linux.

## v1.5.0 — 2026-07-23

- Add `NewSocketFromPacketConn`, for wrapping an existing `net.PacketConn` (#34)
- Fix writes hanging on freshly accepted connections. An accepted socket is handed to the accept
  callback while still in `CS_SYN_RECV` and only becomes writable once the initiator's first data
  packet arrives, but nothing signalled `UTP_STATE_WRITABLE`, so a `Write` on the accepted `Conn`
  blocked until the `Conn` was destroyed
- CI: stop skipping the nettest read timeout test (fixed by the above)
- CI: quote the benchmark `-run` pattern so Windows works
- Add `CHANGELOG.md` and link to it from the README

## v1.4.0 — 2025-11-21

- Fix unsynchronized event checks and signalling in `waitForConnect`
- Check for port overflow in inproc packetconn
- Make `utp_types.h` safer and compatible with cgo/Go builds (include `<stdint.h>`/`<stdbool.h>`, avoid retypedefs, normalize macros)
- Upgrade `golang.org/x/net` for latest nettest compatibility
- Reduce CI flakiness: skip known-bad test, run nettests sequentially

- Run `gorond`
- Bump `golang.org/x/net` from 0.7.0 to 0.17.0
