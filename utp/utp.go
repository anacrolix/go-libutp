// Package utp provides one interface over both µTP implementations in this module, and picks one
// of them at build time.
//
// By default it uses libutp, the C++ reference implementation, through cgo. Building with the
// purego tag, or with cgo disabled, uses the pure Go implementation in
// [github.com/anacrolix/go-libutp/purego] instead — the tag and the package it selects share a
// name:
//
//	go build -tags purego ./...
//	CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./...
//
// [Default] is whichever one the build selected. [NewSocket] and [NewSocketFromPacketConn] use
// it and have the same signatures as the constructors of those names in both underlying packages,
// so switching a caller over to this package is an import change. Code that wants a particular
// implementation rather than the default can name [Purego] or [Libutp] directly; Libutp only exists
// where libutp is being compiled, which is to say not under the purego tag and not with cgo
// disabled.
//
// Implementations are values, so code that has to work with either can take an [Implementation]
// and be handed one, rather than choosing at its own build time. An Implementation makes a Socket
// over a PacketConn; [Listen] opens one for it.
